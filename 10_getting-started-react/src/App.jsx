      <h2>Why I Want to Learn React</h2>
      <p>
      The reason I want to learn React is to gain a strong understanding of its fundamentals, especially as an aspiring UI/UX designer. It is important for me to know how to work with front-end technologies and understand how they function, because this knowledge allows me to bridge the gap between design and development. In addition, learning React will help me improve and refine my technical skills, making me more versatile as a designer.
